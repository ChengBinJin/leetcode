Then we have $ 0 \\leq i < j \\leq n$ (here end index $j$ is exclusive by convention). Thus, using two nested loops with $i$ from $0$ to $n - 1$ and $j$ from $i + 1$ to $n$, we can enumerate all the substrings of **s**.\n",
    "- To check if one string has duplicate characters, we can use a set. We iterate through all the characters in the string and put them into the **set** one by one. Before putting one character, we check if the set already contains it. If so, we return __false__. After loop, we return **true**."

    "A sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array/string problems. A window is a range of elements in the array/string which usually defined by the start and end indices, i.e. $[i, j)$ (left-closed, right-open). A sliding window \"slides\" its two boundaries to the certain direction. For example, if we slide $[i, j)$ to the right by $1$ element, then it becomes $[i + 1, j+1)$ (left-closed, right-open).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Back to our problem. We use HashSet to store the characters in current window $[i, j)$ ($j = i$ initially). Then we slide the index $j$ to the right. If it is not in the HashSet, we slide $j$ further. Doing so until $s[j]$ is already in the HashSet. At this point, we found the maximum size of substrings without duplicate chracters start with index $i$. If we do this for all $i$, we get our answer. "
